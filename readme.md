# Control Arduino using PubNub

I made this last year. Sorry for the messy code and layout. :/

1. `npm install`
2. `node index.js`
3. Launch index.html anywhere, and it will control an Arduino RGB LED connected to pins 9, 10 and 11.

## To do

Fix the memory leaks. This wonderful webpage will inevitably crash. :D
